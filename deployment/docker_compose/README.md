# Deploying Danswer using Docker Compose

For general information, please read the instructions in this [README](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/deployment/README.md).

## Deploy in a system without GPU support
This part is elaborated precisely in  in this [README](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/deployment/README.md) in section *Docker Compose*. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue or get in touch in slack for support.

## Deploy in a system with GPU support
Running Model servers with GPU support while indexing and querying can result in significant improvements in performance. This is highly recommended if you have access to resources. Currently, Danswer offloads embedding model and tokenizers to the GPU VRAM and the size needed depends on chosen embedding model. Default embedding models `intfloat/e5-base-v2` takes up about 1GB of VRAM and since we need this for inference and embedding pipeline, you would need roughly 2GB of VRAM.

### Setup
To be able to use NVIDIA runtime, following is mandatory:
- proper setup of NVIDIA driver in host system.
- installation of `nvidia-container-toolkit` for passing GPU runtime to containers

You will find elaborate steps here:

#### Installation of NVIDIA Drivers
Visit the official [NVIDIA drivers page](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) to download and install the proper drivers. Reboot your system once you have done so.

Alternatively, you can choose to install the driver versions via package managers of your choice in UNIX based systems. 

#### Installation of `nvidia-container-toolkit`

For GPUs to be accessible to containers, you will need the container toolkit. Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) to install the necessary runtime based on your requirement.

### Launching with GPU

1. To run Danswer with GPU, navigate to `docker_compose` directory and run the following:
   - `docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate`
      - or run: `docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build --force-recreate`
to build from source
   - Downloading images or packages/requirements may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet connection.


2. To shut down the deployment, run:
   - To stop the containers: `docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml -p danswer-stack stop`
   - To delete the containers: `docker compose -f docker-compose.gpu-dev.yml -p danswer-stack down`
